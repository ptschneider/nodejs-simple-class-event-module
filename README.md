#simple-class-event-module

another simple example of nodejs events and modules

I've done TypeScript projects with Node.js, and module problems are the order of the day. (If you remember the early days of C++ when cfront was dominant, everyone just used their favorite backend C compiler/linker, and the screwball linker problems we would have to troubleshoot -- congrats, you can enjoy your old feelings of depair with a modern toolset.)

If Node.js is a runtime you will use a lot, get to know it with regular JS. That understanding will go a long way in troubleshooting TS projects later.
